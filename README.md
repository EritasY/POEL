``Hamiltonian``: plot surface of section from Rath (2022) pendulum model + rescale parameters accordingly <br />
``Surface_of_section``: use Nbody to plot surface of section and compare it to Rath's model <br />
``Stability_boundary_secular``: maximize and minimize secular oscillations + reproduce Fig. 4.1 in thesis <br />
``Stability_boundary_hierarchical``: calculate the 2-planet stability boundary according to Hadden (2018) + run MEGNO to visualize the boundary <br />
``3BR_width``: calculate the widths of 0th-order and 1st-order 3BRs <br />
``2BR_animation``: create animation from Nbody (last block contains solutions to different error codes) <br />
