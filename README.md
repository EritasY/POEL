``Hamiltonian``: plot surface of section from Rath et al. (2022) pendulum model + rescale parameters accordingly <br />
``Surface_of_section``: use Nbody to plot surface of section and compare it to Rath's model <br />
``Test_approximation_secular``: calculate the errors in approximated expressions in Yang & Tamayo (2024) <br />
``Stability_boundary_secular``: maximize and minimize secular oscillations + reproduce Fig. 4.1 in thesis <br />
